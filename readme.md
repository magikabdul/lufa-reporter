The general purpose of this service is to help a user report and generate summaries of work done for two different companies via Telegram.

Each evening, the service sends a Telegram notification asking the user to report the tasks completed that day.
At any time, the user can send a request in Telegram to generate an up-to-date report.
One of the clients requires reporting tasks by categories; therefore, the service uses AI both to assign the appropriate category to each task and to assist in preparing the final report.
